For this default file to run, the bottom of the Quorum generated JavaScript, this:

var $starter = new quorum_Main_();
$starter.Main();
OuTpUt_$tRiNg_;

Must be replaced with this function:

function Start()
{
    var $starter = new quorum_Main_();
    $starter.Main();
    OuTpUt_$tRiNg_;
}

There are many ways to load canvases and this is provided only as an exemplar.
